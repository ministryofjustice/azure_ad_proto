# Azure Active Directory reading prototype

Simple Sinatra App that uses Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) for Ruby to read
data from an Azure hosted AD.


# Deployment

Currently deployed on Heroku https://azure-ad-proto.herokuapp.com/. To query Azure AD you will need to have an account setup in the tools@digital.justice.gov.uk Azure subscription - contact Digital Service Desk for access.


# Azure AD registration

The App is registered in Azure to grant access to its AD. See [Azure AD Integration confluence pages](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/display/NI/Azure+AD+Integration) for details of how to go about this.
